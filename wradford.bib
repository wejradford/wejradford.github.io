  abstract = {Named Entity Linking (NEL) grounds entity mentions to their
  corresponding node in a Knowledge Base (KB).  Recently, a number of systems
  have been proposed for linking entity mentions in text to Wikipedia pages.
  Such systems typically search for candidate entities and then disambiguate
  them, returning either the best candidate or NIL.  However, comparison has
  focused on disambiguation accuracy, making it difficult to determine how
  search impacts performance.  Furthermore, important approaches from the
  literature have not been systematically compared on standard data sets.

  We reimplement three seminal NEL systems and present a detailed evaluation
  of search strategies.  Our experiments find that coreference and acronym
  handling leads to substantial improvement, and search strategies account for
  much of the variation between systems.  This is an interesting finding,
  because these aspects of the problem have often been neglected in the
  literature, which has focused largely on complex candidate ranking
  algorithms.}

Most NER systems rely on statistical models of annotated data to identify and classify names of people, locations and organisations in text. This dependence on expensive annotation is the knowledge bottleneck our work overcomes.

We first classify each Wikipedia article into named entity (NE) types, training and evaluating on 7,200 manually-labelled Wikipedia articles across nine languages. Our cross-lingual approach achieves up to 95\% accuracy.

We transform the links between articles into NE annotations by projecting the target article's classifications onto the anchor text. This approach yields reasonable annotations, but does not immediately compete with existing gold-standard data. By inferring additional links and heuristically tweaking the Wikipedia corpora, we better align our automatic annotations to gold standards.

We annotate millions of words in nine languages, evaluating English, German, Spanish, Dutch and Russian Wikipedia-trained models against CoNLL Shared Task data and other gold-standard corpora. Our approach outperforms other approaches to automatic NE annotation (Richman08,Mika08); competes with gold-standard training when tested on an evaluation corpus from a different source; and performs 10\% better than newswire-trained models on manually-annotated Wikipedia text.}
